# ‚ù§Ô∏è Blood Donation Website

A modern, full-featured blood donation management platform designed to connect blood donors with recipients easily and efficiently. This project enables people in need to find blood donors by filtering through blood group, district, and upazila, while donors can manage their profiles and donation activities seamlessly.

It includes secure role-based dashboards for admins and volunteers, enabling safe management of users, donation requests, funding records, and blog content. With Firebase Authentication, JWT-secured APIs, Stripe payment integration for donations, and a clean, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, this platform offers a complete end-to-end solution for managing blood donation initiatives within a community or organization.

The project demonstrates best practices in authentication, authorization, secure API handling, modern React patterns with React Query, and scalable architecture, making it a strong real-world project for portfolio presentation and practical application.
